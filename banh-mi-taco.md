# Banh Mi Soft Tacos

1. Julienne carrots (or buy if you're lazy like me).  Soak the carrots in a jarful of
the vinegar solution from [this recipe](https://thekitchengirl.com/quick-pickled-carrots-and-daikon/) 
and let sit overnight to pickle.
2. Stir fry literally any type of meat (beef/pork/chicken) with a liberal amount of soy sauce and some pepper.
3. Julienne cucumber.
4. Mix 1 part sriracha sauce with 1 part mayonnaise (the amount is flexible).
5. Wrap all of the previously mentioned ingredients in a small tortilla and serve.
